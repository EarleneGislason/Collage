To use RDMA InfiniBand connections the following is needed:

 1) The rdma_ucm kernel module must be loaded
 2) The application must have read/write access to the IB device nodes
    (typically /dev/infiniband/[rdma_cm|uverbs*])
 3) The IP address used for the connection must be an address assigned to an
    RDMA-capable device (e.g. IPoIB)
 4) Shared memory must be sufficient for all RDMA connections,
    2 * Global::IATTR_RDMA_RING_BUFFER_SIZE_MB are needed for each connection
    set /dev/shm, kernel.shm[min|max|all] accordingly
 5) The user must be able to lock the memory registered with verbs, such
    that the locked memory limit needs to be sufficient ("ulimit -l" for
    bash, "limit memorylocked" for csh).  Updating /etc/security/limits.conf
    with entries like this is usually adequate (e.g. to raise the limit
    to 2GB for all users):
    * soft memlock 2048000
    * hard memlock 2048000
